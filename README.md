      docker info
A Docker container consists of network settings, volumes, and images. The location of Docker files depends on your operating system. Here is an overview for the most used operating systems:
# Docker DIR
    Ubuntu: /var/lib/docker/
    Fedora: /var/lib/docker/
    Debian: /var/lib/docker/
    Windows: C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop
    MacOS: ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/
# The internal structure of the Docker root folder
      $ ls -la /var/lib/docker
      
            total 152

# Docker images
The heaviest contents are usually images. If you use the default storage driver overlay2, then your Docker images are stored in /var/lib/docker/overlay2. There, you can find different files that represent read-only layers of a Docker image and a layer on top of it that contains your changes.
# Clean up space used by Docker
       docker system prune -a
# remove unused volumes by executing:
      docker volumes prune
# Docker backup
Docker has become an essential tool for many developers in recent years, allowing them to create and manage containerized applications with ease. One of the most significant advantages of Docker is its ability to manage data volumes, allowing you to store data that persists beyond the lifetime of a container.

However, even with its many benefits, Docker’s volume management can sometimes be challenging. In particular, taking backups and restoring volumes can be a complex and error-prone process. In this article, we’ll explore why you might need to take backups of your volumes and how to do it correctly.
## Disaster Recovery
The most obvious reason to take backups of your Docker volumes is to protect against data loss in the event of a disaster. By taking regular backups of your volumes, you can ensure that your critical data is safe and recoverable in case of an emergency.
## Step 1: Identify the Volume
The first step in taking a backup of a volume is to identify the volume that you want to back up. You can do this by running the following command:

      docker volume ls
This will show you a list of all the volumes that are currently available on your Docker host. Note down the name of the volume that you want to back up.
